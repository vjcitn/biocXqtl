Description: This is a modular system for creating molecular QTL statistics.  Given
	a RangedSummarizedExperiment with assay elements comprised of molecular 
	responses like RNA-seq counts, and genotype calls in colData,
	results of association tests will be bound into the rowData of 
	the input RangedSummarizedExperiment.
Depends: R (>= 4.4.0), utils, SummarizedExperiment
